    "\n",
    "N = Number of people in a test pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "p = Percentage chance an individual has covid given a test was done, a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) = Probability an individual has Covid given a Test was done = p.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = Probability the test pool is postive.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = The probability an individual tests positive for covid given the test pool is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) = The probability the test pool is positive given an individual tests positive in the test pool = 1, because if the individual in the test pool tests postive the whole pool will test positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Ac) = Probability an individual does not have a positive Covid test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|Ac) = The probability a test pool is postiive given the individual does not have covid, meaning 1 to N-1 people in the pool have covid but not A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this work is to calculate P(A|B), the probability an individual tests positive for covid given the test pool is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|Ac)P(Ac)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, P(B|A) = 1 as previously stated, P(A) = p, and P(Ac) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - p.\n",
    "Thus, this reduces to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B)=\\frac{p}{p+P(B|Ac)(1-p)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, P(B|Ac) can be calculated using the binomial distribution, which will give us the probability of x sucesses given a probability p, and a number of trials N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial Probability:\n",
    "$P(x;p,n)=\\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is embeded in the Tensorflow probability binomial distribution function which was used.  The results were summed for x = 1 to N-1 sucesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, essentially we can calculate the probability an individual tests positive for Covid given the test pool had a positive result using only p (the probability an individual has covid given a test for covid) and N (the number of people in a test pool)."
