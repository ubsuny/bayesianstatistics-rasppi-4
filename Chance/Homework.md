# Chance's Homework

**Problem 1**
For problem 1, I used Bayle's Theorem and the tensorflow Binomial Distribution to solve this probability problem.  Everything went as planned and is explained in detail under Problem 1.

**Problem 2**
For problem 2, I used the article and github code it came with to predict the CO2 data from the Mauna Lou Laboratory.  The code was adapted to work with the functions already installed on my Raspberry pi 4.
